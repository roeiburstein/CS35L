	* quote-3.0-patch.txt: The purpose of this patch is to modify
	the use of quotes, due to the changes in the GNU coding
	standards. Instead of quoting: `hello' and ``hello", now the
	convension is to use 'hello' and "hello". These changes only
	apply to comments, and .c files that use ` as a special character
	are accordingly modified not to break the code.
