To begin, I created a new folder to start the homework and cloned a new
version of diffutils. I used the command from the lab:
git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils. Then I checked out v3.0 of the directory
into a new branch called quote with the command git checkout -b quote v3.0.

Then I applied the patch with the command:
patch -p1 < ../lab/quote-3.0-patch.txt. My output was the following:

   patching file src/cmp.c
   patching file src/diff.c
   patching file src/diff3.c
   patching file src/dir.c
   patching file src/sdiff.c
   patching file src/util.c

This output is expected, as these are the .c files that my patch was supposed
to change.

Now my next step was to create the changelog within my quote-3.0-patch.txt
file. To do this, I typed emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt and use the command
C-x 4 a, as specified in the instructions, to write a ChangeLog for the file.
My ChangeLog is as follows:

   * quote-3.0-patch.txt: The purpose of this patch is to modify
   the use of quotes, due to the changes in the GNU coding
   standards. Instead of quoting: `hello' and ``hello", now the
   convension is to use 'hello' and "hello". These changes only
   apply to comments, and .c files that use ` as a special character
   are accordingly modified not to break the code.

The I used the command C-x C-s to save the ChangeLog and then saved my file
with C-x C-c as usual.

Next, I commited my changes with the ChangeLog as my commit statement. I added
my changes with the command git add . and then commited with the command
git commit -F ChangeLog.

Now I wanted to create a patch file that would not require me to make any
changes by hand. To do this, I ran the command
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt. This worked for me with no
issues.

My next step was to exchange formatted-patch.txt files with my partner so that
each of us could test out if our patches work. My partner for this assignment
is Omer Katz in lab section 8. After sending and receiving the patch files, I
moved it to SEASnet and into my diffutils directory for testing.

To verify that his patch works, I did git checkout -b quote-new v3.0 and then
did git am < patch_omer.txt. It sucessfully ran with no problems. I ran
./bootstrap, ./configure, make, and make check after to rebuild using the
patch.

To verify that the ChangeLog entry works, I ran the command make distdir and
then inspected the diffutils*/ChangeLog. The initial message on the log was my
message to confirm that the ChangeLog worked successfully.

Finally, I logged out of SEASnet and logged in again while using the -X flag
so that I could use X forwarding. To do this, I used the command:
ssh -X classrbu@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu. Then, I went into the emacs directory
with the command cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs and then ran the gitk command.

When I did this, I saw a window pop up with the repository, and looked through
the long commit list and found a merge dated back in January 2015.
