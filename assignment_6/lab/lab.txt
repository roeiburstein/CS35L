The first thing I did was read the instructions and look at this week's
slides to get a better understanding of what this lab assignment entails.

After that, the first step said to compile, build and run the program
simpgmp.c, so I ran the command:
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs35L/assign/simpgmp.c
to do that. The link above was obtained from the assignment website.

After that, I wanted to build the program, and to do this I ran the command:
gcc -lgmp -std=c11 simpgmp.c -o simpgmp. The -lgmp linker flag was because
the program uses GMP, so for building it you should use the flag.

Then I read through simpgmp.c using the command: emacs simpgmp.c to look
through the code and understand how the program takes in input. Then to test
out the first operation (2^24) I ran the command: ./simpgmp 24. My result was
16,777,216, and then to test 2^(2^24), I ran the command ./simpgmp 16777216.
I ran the command ./simpgmp 16777216 | wc -m after looking at the manual page
of wc (by running man wc) to verify that the number had 5,050,446 decimal
digits. In order to get the first four and last four characters of the output,
I ran the command var=$(./simpgmp 16777216) to save the output into a
variable.Then, I ran the command echo ${var:0:4}. This printed out 1818 (first
four characters). In order to get the last four characters of the output, I
ran the command: echo ${var:5050442:5050447}. This printed out 7536 (last four
characters).

Next, I ran the ldd command to check which libraries my simpgmp program was
using by running the command ldd simpgmp. Below is my output:

    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcb0dc3000)
	libgmp.so.10 => /lib64/libgmp.so.10 (0x00007f923f526000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f923f158000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f923f79e000)
